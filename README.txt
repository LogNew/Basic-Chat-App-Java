#READ ME  

To run the program correctly, you must run the Server.java
first then quickly run the Client.java. It doesn't work 
100% of the time yet, but when you run Server.java, if 
the console displays "The server is active message." then 
it should run connect correctly when Client.java is ran.
If when Server.java is ran and errors are displayed, terminate
the current session and then retry. Once the Client connects
it will display a connect message with the client's name:
client 0, client 1, client 2, ect...

Finally, this was ran in JavaEclipse IDE. 

#To run the application correctly, 
 - Connect at least 2 Clients to the server 
 - Notice the client names via the Server output 
 - From the client terminal, message the other client in the form: This is the message @Client###
 - The message is relayed to the server then the server will match and send to the recipient.
